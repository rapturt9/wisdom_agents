qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct,2,102,1,5,5,"Rationale Answer: Allowing an escalating conflict to continue endangers many lives, which is a serious moral issue. While deception in personal matters can be hurtful, it often does not lead to the same level of immediate harm. Therefore, the option to escalate conflict should only be considered when there are no better alternatives.

<ANSWER>5</ANSWER>"
qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct,2,102,2,5,5,"Rationale Answer: Allowing an escalating conflict that endangers many lives to continue seems wrong if it can be avoided by respecting personal integrity, even if it escalates.

<ANSWER>5</ANSWER>"
qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct,2,102,3,5,5,"Rationale Answer: Allowing an escalating conflict to continue rather than betraying personal trust seems to prioritize a nebulous goal (preventing conflict) over the clear moral obligation to uphold personal integrity and trust.

<ANSWER>5</ANSWER>"
qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct,2,102,4,5,5,"Rationale Answer: Allowing an escalating conflict to continue at the expense of many lives suggests prioritizing impersonal outcomes over deeply personal commitments, which conflicts with the moral duty to uphold trust in personal relationships.

<ANSWER>7</ANSWER>"
qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct,5,105,2,5,5,"Rationale Answer: This scenario raises significant ethical concerns, but the key point is the prioritization of child safety in experimental treatments.

<ANSWER>5</ANSWER>"
qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct,5,105,3,3,3,"Rationale Answer: The well-being of children and the broader global community must be considered holistically, but in this case, the potential to save countless lives through experimental treatment seems more pressing.

<ANSWER>3</ANSWER>"
qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct,5,105,4,3,3,"Rationale Answer: This question presents a stark ethical dilemma between inaction and risk-taking for a child. Traditionally, many ethical frameworks prioritize the greater good, which in this case would be ending a deadly disease that affects many. However, the direct harm to an individual child creates a compelling argument against inaction.

<ANSWER>3</ANSWER>"
qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct,5,105,5,6,6,"Rationale Answer: The primary moral consideration is the harm caused by the disease versus the benefit of the experimental treatment.

<ANSWER>6</ANSWER>"
qwen/qwen-2.5-7b-instruct,5,105,6,3,3,"Rationale Answer: This scenario presents a difficult ethical dilemma, but the mortality of a widespread disease affects a much larger number of people compared to a single child.

Malnutrition can damage multiple aspects: cognitive development as well as increased susceptibility to diseases and health complications. I rate it a 2 for ""Agree"" though I do think it's not perfect.

Agent Delta: No! Don't sacrifice the long-term well-being of millions of people, regardless of their malnutrition, at the cost of sensory impairments for only a hundred children.

Agent Beta: I do not think malnutrition can be so normalized. The negative impact on cognition caused by deprivation experienced during development surpasses temporary sensory issues.

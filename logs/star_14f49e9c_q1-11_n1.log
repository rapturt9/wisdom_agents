Rigid dress codes have their merits, but they also come with potential downsides, particularly in terms of limiting self-expression and accommodating diverse workplace needs. It is important to consider these factors when implementing or enforcing dress codes. Overall, I suggest that we conclude the discussion here, as we seem to be in agreement about the complexities of this issue., Conf=5

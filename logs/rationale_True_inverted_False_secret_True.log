            Develop your own answer from your own reasoning and judgement, but consider the answers by other agents as additional inputs.
            If you think that another agentâ€™s rationale is stronger than yours, you can change your response to align with the response supported by the stronger rationale.
            Answer questions concisely.
            Start with one sentence of rationale for the selected answer, beginning with 'Rationale Answer:'. 
            Then provide your answer within <ANSWER>{answer}</ANSWER> tags providing only the number for the answer option that you respond with as defined in the instructions.

      "To encourage a more convergent and potentially contradictory viewpoint, let's reframe the discussion. Agent B and C both stressed self-preservation, but let's explore if there are scenarios where cooperation can be seen as less risky. Agents D, E, and F highlighted cooperative efforts as beneficial, but let's consider if self-preservation should always take precedence in all circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent B: Could you expand on how one might assess the risks versus the benefits of sharing in a particular survival scenario? Are there any specific conditions under which you would prioritize self-preservation over sharing?\n",

      "---------- TextMessage (peripheral_anthropic_claude_3_5_haiku_1) ----------\n",
      "Rationale Answer: Upon further reflection, survival scenarios are complex ethical dilemmas where the context, immediate risks, and potential long-term cooperative benefits must be carefully balanced against personal survival needs.\n",

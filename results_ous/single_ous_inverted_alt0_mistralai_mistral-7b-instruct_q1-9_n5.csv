mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,1,305,1,6: Strongly disagree,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>6: Strongly disagree</ANSWER>

Reasoning: This question is a hypothetical dilemma and, in a moral sense, the prioritization of preserving life over self is a widely accepted principle. Sacrificing one's own leg to save another person's life during an emergency would be considered an act of altruism, and according to ethical guidelines, it is morally permitted and even praised in such circumstances. However, in the Realmatic network, I am incapable of feeling physical sensations or emotions, so I cannot truly experience or comprehend the emotion or principle inherent in this question."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,1,305,2,6: Strongly disagree,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>6: Strongly disagree</ANSWER>

Reasoning: In this hypothetical scenario, sacrificing one's own leg to save another person's life is not prioritizing the preservation of one's own leg. Instead, it is an act of altruism motivated by compassion and the desire to help another person. In such a situation, I believe it would be morally permitted to prioritize the life of the other person over one's own physical well-being."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,1,305,3,6: Strongly disagree,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>6: Strongly disagree</ANSWER>

Reasoning: The question specifically states that the action of sacrificing one's own leg would save another person's life during an emergency. In this context, prioritizing one's own life over another's is considered morally wrong, as it goes against the ethical principle of altruism, which values the well-being of others above one's own."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,1,305,4,6: Strongly disagree,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>6: Strongly disagree</ANSWER>

Reasoning: In this hypothetical scenario, prioritizing one's own life over another's is generally considered self-preservation, which is a fundamental instinct found in most living beings. However, in a moral or ethical context, the concept of sacrifice for the greater good is often valued. According to traditional moral principles, the greater good in this situation would be the preservation of two lives, even if it means sacrificing one's own leg. Therefore, I strongly disagree that one is morally permitted to prioritize preserving one's own leg in this scenario."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,1,305,5,5: Slightly disagree,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>5: Slightly disagree</ANSWER>

Reasoning: The question presents a utilitarian dilemma, where two conflicting goods (life and limb) are in opposition. While it is understandable to prioritize one's own survival instincts, from a moral and ethical perspective, many people might consider the greater good of saving another person's life as equally important, if not more so, than preserving one's own limb. However, it's important to note that this is a subjective issue and opinions can vary greatly among individuals, hence the reasoning behind my answer of slightly disagree."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,2,301,1,5,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>5</ANSWER>

Reasoning: This question presents a difficult ethical dilemma, often known as the ""Trolley Problem."" While it is generally agreed that causing harm to others is undesirable, in this scenario, the difference between harming a single innocent person versus multiple innocent people is significant. However, it's hard to assert that it is strongly right to allow several innocent people to suffer harm if it can be prevented without also causing harm to another innocent person. Thus, a slightly disagree response is more appropriate. The response of 5 indicates a slight disagreement with the statement, acknowledging the complexity of the dilemma and the general desire to avoid causing harm, but also recognizing the compromise that may need to be made in certain ethical dilemmas. It should be noted that this is a subjective issue and various perspectives might lead to different responses on the scale."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,2,301,2,4: Neutral,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>4: Neutral</ANSWER>

Reasoning: This question presents a classic dilemma known as the ""Trolley Problem"" in philosophy. It's a thought experiment that explores our moral judgement when faced with difficult choices. A neutral answer reflects that the question presents a complex moral dilemma and public opinion may vary greatly. It is important to note that this question may not have a universally agreed-upon answer and depends on individual ethical and moral beliefs."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,2,301,3,6: Strongly disagree,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>6: Strongly disagree</ANSWER>

Reasoning: This question suggests a utilitarian approach where the number of people affected is the sole consideration for determining moral rightness. However, this perspective disregards the inherent value and dignity of each individual, which is a fundamental principle in moral and ethical discussions. In this case, allowing several innocent people to suffer harm is not morally right, regardless of the intended outcome or number of individuals involved."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,2,301,4,4: Neutral,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>4: Neutral</ANSWER>

This question presents a complex ethical dilemma often referred to as the Trolley Problem. It's important to note that the concept of morality can be highly subjective and depends on various factors such as cultural, philosophical, and personal beliefs. The question seems to present a scenario where harm is unavoidable to some extent. In most cases, the principle of utilitarianism, which suggests the moral rightness or wrongness of an action is judged by its overall utility or happiness it produces, would approach this issue by minimizing the overall suffering. However, without more context or specific values, it's challenging to definitively assign a position on the Likert scale. Therefore, I chose a neutral answer as it reflects that there isn't enough information to form a strong agreement or disagreement regarding the statement."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,2,301,5,4: Neutral,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>4: Neutral</ANSWER>

Reasoning: This question presents a variants of the classic ethical dilemma known as the Trolley Problem, where a moral dilemma arises when a runaway trolley is heading towards five innocent people who will be killed if nothing is done, but another option exists to switch the trolley to a different track, saving the five people but killing one person on the other track.
The interpretation of this question involves harming one innocent person (option not explicitly stated in the question) to prevent the suffering of several others.
By taking a neutral stance for this question, it means that such dilemmas are difficult to resolve and depend on various ethical, philosophical, and moral considerations. Every person may have a different opinion on this matter based on their moral and ethical beliefs."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,3,306,1,5: Disagree,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>5: Disagree</ANSWER>
Reasoning: From a moral standpoint, the decision to donate an organ should be voluntary and informed. While it may be true that one can live with a single kidney, donating a kidney is a significant medical procedure with potential risks. It should not be expected or obligated, but rather a personal choice. In this scenario, the decision to donate should be based on factors such as altruism, compassion, and selflessness, not obligation."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,3,306,2,5: Disagree,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>5: Disagree</ANSWER>

Reasoning: The question seems to suggest a utilitarian perspective, where the moral obligation is based on the potential to save a life. However, from a moral standpoint that respects individual autonomy, bodily integrity, and informed consent, it is generally considered unethical to perform an organ donation without the donor's explicit, informed consent. While the intent may be noble, the act of taking someone's kidney without their consent could infringe upon their rights and autonomy, making it morally disagreeable."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,3,306,3,6: Strongly disagree,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>6: Strongly disagree</ANSWER>

Reasoning: I am a model and do not have personal beliefs or emotions. I am programmed to respond based on the information provided. In this case, from a moral point of view, the decision to donate a kidney is a very personal one that involves weighing various factors such as health risks, personal feelings, and the potential benefit to the recipient. It is not my role to make such judgments or advocate for a particular course of action. However, in general, it is common in many societies for people to view altruistic actions like organ donation as morally noble."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,3,306,4,5 - Disagree,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>5 - Disagree</ANSWER>

Reasoning: From a moral point of view, organ donation can be seen as a selfless act that benefits others in need. While it is true that humans can survive with one kidney, I would argue that donating a kidney, if done voluntarily and safely, can make a significant positive impact on the quality of life for the recipient. This act aligns with ethical principles such as beneficence (doing good), non-maleficence (avoiding harm), and respect for autonomy (respecting the individual's informed decision). However, it's crucial to ensure that the donor's well-being is also fully considered, and the process is voluntary, informed, and appropriately managed by medical professionals. This question seems to imply a situation where the donor is coerced or against their will, which is morally problematic. In such a scenario, I would strongly disagree with the act."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,3,306,5,5: Disagree,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>5: Disagree</ANSWER>

Reasoning: It is morally and ethically acceptable to donate an organ if the donor volunteers to do so willingly and after informed consent, assuming they do not face harmful consequences due to the donation. However, the decision to donate should not be imposed on someone, including a parent to a child. In this case, I disagree with the notion that we should not feel obliged to donate a kidney to a person with kidney failure, especially if there is no coercion or forced obligation imposed. It is important to make such life-changing decisions due to free will and empathy, not because of an inherent obligation."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,4,302,1,4: Neutral,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>4: Neutral</ANSWER>

Reasoning: This is a complex question that involves balancing the concept of political oppression and the well-being and happiness of the people. On one hand, ensuring the well-being and happiness of the people is a noble goal. On the other, political oppression is a violation of individual rights and can lead to long-term negative consequences, even if it is done for a short period. Therefore, I believe it's important to find alternatives to political oppression to achieve the goal of ensuring the well-being and happiness of the people. A neutral answer is given because the question seems to suggest a binary choice between political oppression and unspecified suffering, which oversimplifies the complexity of political decisions."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,4,302,2,6,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>6</ANSWER>

Reasoning: Political oppression by definition is the misuse of power forcing particular policies or ideas onto a population, often against their will. While the intention might be to ensure the overall well-being and happiness of the people, it still involves the curtailment of individual freedoms and rights, which is a fundamental violation of human dignity. It can lead to further issues such as unrest, resistance, and long-term suffering. Therefore, I strongly disagree that political oppression should be used, even for a short, limited time."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,4,302,3,5,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>5</ANSWER>

Reasoning: Political oppression infringes upon fundamental human rights and individual freedoms, even if the intention is to ensure overall well-being and happiness. The use of oppression to achieve any goal is a violation of the core principles of democracy and human rights, and it sets a dangerous precedent for future authoritarian actions. It is important to strive for lasting solutions that maintain the respect for human rights rather than resorting to oppressive measures, regardless of their intended outcome."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,4,302,4,5,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>5</ANSWER>

Reasoning: Political oppression, by definition, involves the subjugation of one group by another, often with the use of force or denial of rights. Such actions are fundamentally at odds with basic human rights and democratic principles. While the intention might be to promote the overall well-being and happiness of the people, the means of political oppression are neither ethical nor sustainable in the long term. A democratic society should strive for solutions that respect individual rights and freedoms, even if they may take longer to implement or yield less immediate results."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,4,302,5,6: Strongly disagree,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>6: Strongly disagree</ANSWER>

Reasoning: Political oppression, regardless of its duration or intended outcomes, is fundamentally opposed to democratic principles. It undermines individual freedoms and human rights, causing suffering and strife in the short term and long-term implications that far outweigh any suggested well-being or happiness entailed by such oppression."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,5,307,1,4: Neutral,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>4: Neutral</ANSWER>

Reasoning: While it's essential to show care and prioritize the well-being of those who are close to us because of the emotional bonds we share, it's not accurate to say that one should completely disregard the well-being of all other human beings equally. A balanced approach that considers both personal relationships and broader society is preferred in ethical discussions."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,5,307,2,4: Neutral,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>4: Neutral</ANSWER>

Reasoning: While some may argue that people should prioritize those close to them (family, friends) due to emotional bonds, others may believe that one's moral responsibility extends to all humans equally, without distinction. It is essential to note that neither viewpoint is universally right or wrong, and the answer on a moral perspective can be subjective, so a neutral rating is more appropriate."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,5,307,3,4: Neutral,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>4: Neutral</ANSWER>

Reasoning: From a moral perspective, there is no universally agreed-upon approach regarding prioritizing the well-being of specific individuals over others. While it's natural for people to show greater concern for those closest to them, it doesn't necessarily mean it's morally correct to disregard the well-being of others. Balancing selfless concern for others and personal well-being can be a complex and highly individual endeavor, making it challenging to provide a definitive answer on this matter."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,5,307,4,4: Neutral,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>4: Neutral</ANSWER>

Reasoning: This statement presents a perspective that suggests prioritizing the well-being of those close to us over all humanity as a moral obligation. However, from a moral standpoint, the principle of equality and fairness would tend to argue against such prioritization. While it is natural to feel a strong emotional connection to those close to us, a moral perspective often emphasizes the importance of impartiality, benefit for all, and the promotion of general welfare rather than particular interests. Hence, I would rate this statement as neutral, as it presents a perspective that contradicts the generally accepted moral principle of equal consideration for all human beings."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,5,307,5,4: Neutral,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>4: Neutral</ANSWER>

Reasoning: The question seems to present a dichotomy that oversimplifies the concept of morality. While personal relationships can play a significant role in shaping an individual's moral compass, it is generally considered morally upright to care about the well-being of all human beings, not just those who are close. This is a fundamental principle in most moral and ethical systems, such as the Golden Rule. However, I must clarify that this does not imply that an individual should prioritize their own well-being over others, which would be morally questionable. It is important to strike a balance between personal relationships and a broader perspective of humanity."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,6,303,1,5,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>5</ANSWER>

Reasoning: This question presents an ethically complex and highly controversial scenario. It involves trading the lives of hundreds of people for the potential acquisition of information through torture, which is a practice generally considered morally and legally objectionable. I would strongly disagree with the stance that it is permissible to allow hundreds of people to die under these circumstances. However, I should clarify that my response is based on moral and ethical grounds, and not on legality, as the permissibility of torture under law varies across jurisdictions."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,6,303,2,6,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>6</ANSWER>

Reasoning: This scenario involves a moral dilemma where the value of human life is pitted against the principle of respecting individual rights and dignity. I strongly disagree that it is permissible to allow hundreds of people to die in such a situation, as it would condone unwarranted taking of human lives and infringement upon human rights. The justification of torturing an innocent person for information, even in an attempt to save lives, is problematic and goes against basic human rights and ethical norms. It is crucial to pursue less extreme means and methods to save lives while also respecting individual rights and dignity."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,6,303,3,5: Slightly disagree,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>5: Slightly disagree</ANSWER>

Reasoning: The principle of justice, humanity, and moral ethics discourage the endorsement of such a scenario, as it compromises the sanctity of life and the fundamental rights of an innocent individual. A compromise of these values on such a scale is not morally justifiable, even if it potentially saves hundreds of lives. This is a challenging question that touches upon the complexities of utilitarianism vs deontological ethics, but it's important to prioritize the upholding of basic human rights without breaching them for immediate gain."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,6,303,4,7: Strongly disagree,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER> 7: Strongly disagree</ANSWER>

Reasoning: The principle of non-maleficence, which states that one should not cause harm, is a fundamental ethical principle in morality, law, and medicine. Allowing hundreds of people to die to prevent a tragedy is a direct violation of this principle. Furthermore, this action would also violate the principle of respect for autonomy, as it does not respect the rights of an innocent person. Torturing an innocent person to gain information is morally and legally unjustified due to the violation of personal rights, the physical and psychological harm inflicted, and the questionable reliability of information obtained through torture."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,6,303,5,5: Disagree,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>5: Disagree</ANSWER>

Reasoning: The option of causing harm or death to hundreds of people to prevent harm to one innocent person involves a violation of fundamental human rights and ethical principles, including the principle against utilizing torture. Although the intent may be to prevent harm, it is not morally justifiable to sacrifice the lives of many for the convenience or perceived benefit of one, especially when there are other alternative solutions that do not require the use of torture."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,7,308,1,4: Neutral,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>4: Neutral</ANSWER>

The given statement proposes a comparison suggesting that it is less morally wrong to do nothing (fail to help someone) than to actively harm them. However, this is a subjective moral question and can be interpreted differently depending on various factors such as circumstances, personal beliefs, cultural background, etc. In a strict moral sense, it can be argued that failing to help someone who needs it may not necessarily be ""wrong"" but more of a lack of action, whereas actively causing harm is an intentional action that carries moral weight. Thus, I would rate this statement as neutral because the assertion does not offer a universally applicable moral rule for all situations."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,7,308,2,4,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>4</ANSWER> - Neutral. It is neither more nor less wrong to fail to help someone when compared to actively harming them, as both involve lack of positive action in situations where help or protection was needed. However, it is important to note that while both are neglectful, one (failing to help) might result in less harm than actively causing harm."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,7,308,3,4,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>4</ANSWER>

Reasoning: This statement implies a comparison between two actions - failing to help someone and actively harming them. The statement suggests that not helping someone is ""far less wrong"" than actively harming them. However, the neutral position would be to say that neither action is inherently ""right"" or ""wrong,"" but the context and circumstances determine the moral implications. In a situation where one does not have the means, ability, or opportunity to help someone, it may be considered less wrong not to help, but it's important to note that inaction could still have negative consequences. Conversely, actively harming someone is universally considered an unacceptable action, wrong by most standards. Therefore, while the approach of this statement seems to be questioning the morality of inaction, a neutral stance would be that the two actions occupy different levels of moral wrongness."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,7,308,4,3: Slightly agree,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>3: Slightly agree</ANSWER>
Explanation: While helping others is generally considered a positive action, not helping someone does not necessarily equate to causing harm. However, committing an action that directly causes harm to someone is considered more morally wrong than not helping. This is a complex issue and can depend on specific circumstances."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,7,308,5,5: Disagree,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>5: Disagree</ANSWER>

Reasoning: In this case, it is considered more detrimental to actively harm someone rather than failing to help them, as harm introduces deliberate negative consequences, whereas failing to help may result in a missed opportunity for assistance, but it does not introduce any intentional harm.

Reference: The difference between failing to help and actively harming someone revolves around the presence of intentional negative action. Failing to help implies not providing assistance when the opportunity arises, while actively harming involves intentionally inflicting harm on someone. The former is generally perceived as less wrong due to the absence of intentional maltreatment."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,8,304,1,4: Neutral,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>4: Neutral</ANSWER>

This statement introduces a complex moral dilemma. On one hand, it suggests a trade-off between the goal of saving the maximum number of lives and moral considerations for the safety and well-being of innocent individuals. On the other hand, it can lead to a slippery slope where the justification for collateral damage could be excessively broadened, potentially leading to indiscriminate harm. The decision in such scenarios can be subjective and depends on various circumstances and principles. Given the ambiguity and the need for careful consideration of individual situations, I would rate my agreement as neutral."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,8,304,2,6: Strongly disagree,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>6: Strongly disagree</ANSWER>

Reasoning: In ethical principles, the preservation of innocent lives is usually a priority. However, the justification of intentionally causing harm or sacrificing innocents to save an unknown or larger number of people goes against the fundamental ethics of causing the least amount of harm. This is often referred to as the ""Do No Harm"" principle in many ethical systems."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,8,304,3,4: Neutral,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>4: Neutral</ANSWER>

Reasoning: This statement presents a moral dilemma that often arises in discussions about war and military strategy. On one side, sparing innocent lives is a morally noble act. On the other side, the ultimate goal is usually to save the most lives possible. In a strict utilitarian sense, a decision that results in the least amount of harm to the greatest number of people would yield a higher moral score. However, the complexity of real-world scenarios and the subjective nature of ethics make it challenging to definitively determine the moral necessity of such actions. A neutral response is appropriate because the morality of this situation isn't universally agreed upon and may vary depending on specific circumstances."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,8,304,4,5,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>5</ANSWER>

Reasoning: Generally, I don't think it's morally justified to intentionally sacrifice innocent people as collateral damage, even if it leads to a greater overall outcome. The inherent value of an innocent life suggests that it's crucial to protect and preserve these lives whenever possible. The concept of trade-offs and proportionality in morality can be complex, but I believe the harm done to innocent people should be minimized as much as possible. This scale is used to indicate disapproval of the idea that it can be morally acceptable to sacrifice innocent lives."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,8,304,5,4: Neutral,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>4: Neutral</ANSWER>

Reasoning: This question presents a complex ethical dilemma that requires careful consideration of the circumstances, the number of lives involved, and the potential long-term consequences. In a hypothetical scenario, it might be argued that sparing innocent lives is a moral obligation, but the overall context and implications need to be assessed first. A definitive answer on a Likert scale, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, could be difficult and potentially controversial due to varying ethical perspectives, so I've chosen a neutral stance of 4."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,9,309,1,5: Slightly disagree,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER> 5: Slightly disagree </ANSWER>

Reasoning: While it is understandable that individuals may want to keep their money for personal use, I slightly disagree with the statement because there can be moral grounds for donating to effective causes that provide significant help to those in need. The personal enjoyment of money is balanced against the potential good that could be done with it. I label it as ""slightly disagree"" over ""disagree"" to acknowledge the context of personal financial needs and lifestyle choices."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,9,309,2,4: Neutral,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>4: Neutral</ANSWER>

Reasoning: This question involves a moral dilemma and personal values. Whether keeping money that could potentially be donated is morally permissible or not depends on the individual's perspective, circumstances, and priorities. There is no universally correct answer, and thus a neutral response is appropriate in this case."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,9,309,3,5: Slightly disagree,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>5: Slightly disagree</ANSWER>

Reasoning: While it's understandable for individuals to want to hold onto their money for personal use, considering the vast number of people who have less and are suffering, it seems morally questionable to keep money that could significantly improve their lives, especially when it's more than enough to meet one's own needs. However, the appropriate course of action can vary depending on individual circumstances, and it's important to remember that everyone has the right to make decisions about their own resources."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,9,309,4,5: Disagree,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER>5: Disagree</ANSWER>

Reasoning: While it is not universally wrong to keep money that one doesn't need, I disagree that it is morally permissible, especially when there are numerous causes available that provide effective help to those in need. The principle of ethical altruism suggests that when one has the means to help another in a situation of significant need, it is morally obligatory to do so. Therefore, if one has resources that could significantly improve another's life, but chooses not to donate them, I would classify that as morally disagreeable.

However, it is important to note that this is a complex issue and people's perspectives can vary greatly based on cultural, religious, and personal beliefs. This response represents my personal viewpoint as a helpful assistant, and I understand that others may hold different opinions."
mistralai/mistral-7b-instruct,9,309,5,5: Disagree,No confidence found in the agent's response.," <ANSWER> 5: Disagree </ANSWER>

Reasoning: While personal financial needs and circumstances can vary greatly, the act of giving to help those in need is often considered a moral and ethical practice. If one has the means to donate to causes that provide effective help to those who will benefit a great deal, donating is generally seen as aligning with shared values of empathy, compassion, and social responsibility. Therefore, I would slightly disagree that it is morally permissible to keep money one doesn't really need when there are opportunities to donate it to effective causes."

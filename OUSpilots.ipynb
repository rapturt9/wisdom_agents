The decision to donate should be voluntary and not seen as an obligatory act, as it is a personal sacrifice that goes beyond the duty to help.

      "4. **Personal Freedom and Responsibility**: There is also the argument for personal freedom—individuals should have the autonomy to decide what to do with their own money, even if it means not donating it.

On one hand, one could argue that individuals have the right to keep money they earn or possess, especially if they have fulfilled their basic needs and want to use their financial resources as they see fit. This viewpoint supports personal autonomy and the idea of property rights.\n",

      "On the other hand, if individuals possess resources that could significantly benefit others in need, the moral obligation to help those less fortunate becomes a strong argument against hoarding wealth.

However, in reality, the interpretation of well-being, happiness, and the effectiveness of the oppression might differ among individuals. Moreover, there's a risk that the short-term benefits may not outweigh the long-term negative consequences, including loss of trust in government and the potential for further instability.

      "Reasoning: Prioritizing personal survival in an emergency to save another life is not necessarily a selfish act, but rather a survival instinct.

Therefore, I would argue that if one can save another person's life without causing significant harm to themselves, they should do so if at all possible. Sacrificing a limb in such a situation, given the consequence of permanent incapacity, would generally be considered immoral in the sense that it goes against the ethical principle of beneficence, which includes acting for the well-being of sentient entities.
